(Website Development In Progress!)

"Path of Python" is a website that introduces beginning and intermediate programmers to the Python programming language.

In the website/application, it will introduce learners to the syntax of Python, necessary computer programming vocabulary, and then ease learners into actually writing simple but useful programs.

The website uses repetition, following a simple but effective teaching process to keep learners both intrigued, motivated, while also keeping the process to be "game-like" and entertaining.

The goal of the website is to advance learners of the Python programming language from being a beginner to having a well versed intermediate understanding on both Python and computer programming concepts.
